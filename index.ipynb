    "### Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are a flexible means of creating and displaying nicely formatted web documents that combine text, equations, runnable computer code and the outputs of that code, including rich and interactive visualisations. Jupyter is standard type of notebook that is being very widely adopted across industry and the sciences.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter system consists of a webserver that sends the Jupyter notebooks to web-browser and set of different interactive kernels (ikernels) that handle running code in different computer languages. The system was original developed to use Python. But it now supports R, JavaScript, Julia and many more. A newer version called JupterLab is very similar but tries to recreate the multi-window layout familiar to users of RStudio or Matlab.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the basic case everything runs on your local computer. But because Jupyter notebooks run on web protocols it is possible for the server, the browser and the kernel to all be on different machines. One interesting example of this is [MyBinder.org](mybinder.org) which takes files from [GitHub](https://github.com/) and creates an environment that lets them be run by anyone, anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the current notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/YourBrain/NotebookDemos) and can be run by following this [link](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/yourbrain/notebookdemos/master?filepath=index.ipynb) or pressing this button: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/yourbrain/notebookdemos/master?filepath=index.ipynb)\n"
